Step 0: get a mood suggestion from the user
Step 1: Accessing a user's top 100 songs

How do we identify mood of a song

What are we training the NN on:

neural net stuff:
k means clustering
unsupervised clustering

use existing playlists to as something to compare the clusters to

Step 2: Selecting the top songs that fit the mood


End result: playlist according to mood



Training the neural network against mood-based playlists
Use the 1 million line CSV file to train the NN
